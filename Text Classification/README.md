Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection. Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much any kind of text â€“ from documents, medical studies and files, and all over the web.
