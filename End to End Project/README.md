 # Introduction:
 
 End-to-end machine learning projects refer to the process of developing a machine learning model from data preparation to deployment in a production environment. It involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. The final step is to deploy the model in a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new data.
