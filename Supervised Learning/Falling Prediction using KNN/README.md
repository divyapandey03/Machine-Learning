# Introduction:
- k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) is a simple machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 

- It works by finding the k number of closest training examples to a new data point and classifying the new data point based on the majority of the class labels of its k nearest neighbors.

- The distance metric used to calculate the closest neighbors is typically Euclidean distance.

**Most mobile devices are equipped with different kind of sensors.**
We can use the data sent from Gyroscope sensor and Accelerometer sensor to categorize any motion:
- 3 numbers from Accelerometer sensor.
- 3 numbers from Gyroscope sensor.
