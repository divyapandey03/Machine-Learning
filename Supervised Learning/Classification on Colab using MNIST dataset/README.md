# Introduction
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 
This dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification and accessible from many different sources.

Google Colab provides free access to a Jupyter Notebook and a small version of the MNIST dataset. Aspiring data scientists can use the platform to practice and experiment with the MNIST dataset. The advantage of using Google Colab is that many popular Python libraries are already pre-installed, making it easy to get started with deep learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset is also readily available as a sample, allowing users to quickly dive into data science and machine learning.
